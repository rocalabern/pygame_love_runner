# Love Runner : A videogame based on the classic Lode Runner

This is a small project about develop a simple platform game.

The main purpose is to use this game as part of gift / surprise for a wedding.
It is somehow based on the classic game Lode Runner, so... we called it Love Runner.

Some resources that helped me to choose pygame to develop the game:
